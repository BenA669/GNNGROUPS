[Dataset Creation]
    [Nodes]
        - 4 Groups of Nodes
        - Group is either Fast or Slow speed
        - Group moves in a set direction

    [Connections]
        - In group nodes have a 5% chance of connection
        - Out of group nodes have a 0.1% chance of connection
        - These connections never change

        - Connections form if nodes have a Euclidiean Distance of less than 2
        - Connections disolve if nodes have a Euclidiean Distance of more than 2
        - These connections change over time


[Ego Network Creation]
    - A random index is chosen to be the ego node

    [Mask]
        - Mask: [Timesteps, Max_Nodes]
        - A mask is formed on each timestamp on the nodes connected to the ego node
        - This mask is used for limiting the data the model sees at a given timestamp
