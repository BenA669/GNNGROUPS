[Dataset]
Nodes have a higher chance of being connected if they share a group
Nodes also are connected if close enough to another node and lose the connection when the move apart

Each group has a slow or fast speed
Each group moves in one direction

[Input]
The model is given an anchor node and the neighbors of the anchor node
Given node features (x, y) and dynamic adjacency list of those nodes

[Forward Pass]
2 Layer GCN at timestamp t
GCN Output into LSTM

[Output]
Model outputs embeddings for each node
Clustered using Cross entropy clustering
