Input:
X,Y, adj

Output:
For each node a 16 size vector


To evaluate:
Cluster the vectors using k-means to see the distinction of groups

Loss:
InfoNCE
Higher loss if nodes of different groups have similar vectors


Try model of variable amounts of nodes
Different shapes of node distribution
Find existing dataset (social network, stanford)
Visual embeddings - project to 2d tsne

Constrasting learning

Dynamic groups
    application: Some groups may move together
    Classify high speed nodes / low speed nodes

Modify problem where target node only has infomation on neighbor nodes , timestamp on how far you collect infomation
Nodes may move in and out of adj range
